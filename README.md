# Day 01 - Python Basics and Band Name Generator

## 🔥 What I Learned
- Basics of Python syntax
- Using `print()` to display output
- Accepting user input with `input()`
- Creating and assigning values to variables
- String concatenation to combine user inputs

## 💻 Project: Band Name Generator
I built a simple program that asks the user for:
- The name of the city they grew up in
- Their pet's name

It then generates a fun band name by combining these two inputs!

## 📝 Notes
- Always use descriptive variable names (e.g., `city_name`, `pet_name`).
- Remember that the `input()` function returns a string by default.
- `\n` can be used inside `print()` for a new line.
