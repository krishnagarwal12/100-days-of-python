# Day 03 - Control Flow and the Treasure Island Game

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Comparing values using `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`
- Nesting conditionals and combining conditions with `and`, `or`
- Logical thinking to build branching storylines

## 🎮 Project: Treasure Island Game
Built a text-based adventure game that:
- Takes the player through a series of choices (left/right, swim/wait, door colors)
- Ends with different messages based on their decisions
- Uses simple conditionals to control the game’s flow

## 📝 Notes
- Always be careful with indentation in nested `if` statements
- `input().lower()` is useful to standardize user input
- Game logic planning helps before writing code
